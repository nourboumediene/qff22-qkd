    "Proposed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, thus the name BB84, the BB84 protocol is a scheme that Alice and Bob can use to safely share a key using the two properties of quantum mechanics described above. This protocol makes it impossible for Eve to intercept the key without alerting Alice and Bob.<br>\n",

    "1. Alice generates a random bitstring (zeros and ones) and converts it to a series of qubits correspondingly. The zeros and ones can either be encoded as $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$, or the superposition states $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$. In the first case Alice has chosen the **z-basis**, and in the second choice she has chosen the **x-basis**, where $\\ket{+}$ is a $0$ and $\\ket{-}$ is a $1$. For each bit, she chooses a basis randomly. She then sends everything to Bob.\n",
    "1. Bob measures the received message, measuring each qubit in a random basis (x or z).\n",
    "1. Alice and Bob then make their choice of bases public. They will keep each bit where they used the same basis, and discard the rest. The final bitstring they end up with is the key.\n",
    "1. To make sure that no problems occured during the protocol, Alice and Bob will each reveal a random small sample of predetermined bits from their keys and compare the two versions. If the process was successful, the samples will be the same, otherwise, there will be some differences."
